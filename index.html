We can build on  the ongoing success of the GSU’s September  2020 the study spaces project and the Trini Screen and antigen testing for researchers,  also championed by the GSU, by marrying these  two projects to successfully manage social  bookable space and to be able to create events.  I will review our GSU events, campaigns and  other activities to develop a new strategy for  accessibility and we will find new, positive and  inclusive ways to offer testing on campus for  events as well as other supports as we open up  socially.</span></p>

During my 2019/2020 GSU Vice  Presidency and 2020/2021 GSU Presidency I  actively campaigned with USI and the SU for a  national policy shift on student accommodation.  I have witnessed first-hand the exploitation of  International students which was worsened  by the pandemic. I will fight at every level for  appropriate rent controls and lobby with USI to  make it a reality across the country. In February  2021 I secured a promise of sponsorship  investment to develop the PG accommodation  Facebook page for postgraduates to become a  place of safety and sound advice.

              <p style="text-align: justify;"> I CARE about fair and secure funding for  postgraduate research. Most PhDs in Trinity  are either unfunded or underfunded.<span id="dotsr1">...</span><span id="morer1">This is  symptomatic of the significant underfunding of  research at national level. As President I will be  lobbying for a far greater national investment  in public research for the public good, including  frontline, basic and applied research across the  humanities and sciences. The Cassels Report  in 2011 called for a new national research and  development strategy, Innovation 2020, which  expires last year without reaching its potential.  The development of its replacement, the  National Research Strategy has been slowed  because of COVDI-19 and as GSU President I  intend to seize this opportunity to make sure  postgraduate researchers are heard in the  design of that strategy in 2021/22.

As research can take many years, it is also  essential that postgraduate students and  researchers have access to secure, year-round,  long-term tenancies. I increased beds for  postgraduates on campus in 2019/20 and will  lobby again in 2021 for lease agreements and  to have the rent reviewed as it is currently very  high. As president 2021/22, I will continue to  press for progress on both these issues as part of a more integrated approach to PhD supports.

As part of the GSU I lobbied strongly  to reverse that decision and as President in  2020, I was vigilant this year in ensuring that  rates for research, teaching and lab work were  protected and conditions improved. Research  students deserve certainty of hours in teaching  and tutorial work and set hourly rate of pay for  all hours worked – including preparatory and  correction work. In February 2021 I lobbied  at Finance Committee to instruct The Human  Resources Committee at Trinity College Dublin  to create an Occasional Staff and Casual Pay  Policy. I’ve consulted with the chair of IFUT and  as Unions we have met to offer further input  to HR. My request was granted at Finance  Committee and the draft policy is subject to  approval at Board in June 2021..

As postgraduate students, our thinking, energy, enthusiasm, creativity and investment  is the lifeblood of the institution. <br>After paying a  considerable amount of fees, even more so for  international students, many of you have started  to feel estranged. I will continue to ensure  that College recognises and rewards that with  respect and resources.
