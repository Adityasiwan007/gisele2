After paying a  considerable amount of fees, even more so for  international students, many of you have started  to feel estranged. I will continue to ensure  that College recognises and rewards that with  respect and resources. I have secured €5,000  from the Trinity Trust to help create a student  experience for you which will help you regain a  little of that lost student experience and I will  start building this with and for you in June 2021</span></p>

What started  out as one GSU steward in the 1937 Reading  Room in September 2020 eventually developed  into a campus wide project providing hundreds  of postgraduate jobs in the Public Theatre  (Exam Hall) and the Bank Building, eight  computer labs and finally the Business School  which opened in April 2021. The project is  rostered, pay-roll administrated and nurtured  by me the GSU President and my small team  and I’d like to ensure that this postgraduate  employment endures throughout COVID-19 into  2021.</span></p>

We can build on  the ongoing success of the GSU’s September  2020 the study spaces project and the Trini Screen and antigen testing for researchers,  also championed by the GSU, by marrying these  two projects to successfully manage social  bookable space and to be able to create events.  I will review our GSU events, campaigns and  other activities to develop a new strategy for  accessibility and we will find new, positive and  inclusive ways to offer testing on campus for  events as well as other supports as we open up  socially.</span></p>

I lobbied for greater  accessibility for all students to online learning  and teaching training along with clear and  helpful guidelines at Continuity of Learning and  Student Activities Working Group (COLSAG)  in December 2020 to ensure T.A.s will have  the same technical supports as staff as they  provide valuable teaching hours throughout  2021 and beyond.

As GSU President,  I introduced the idea at Graduate Studies  Committee in December 2020 and it has been  agreed there, class representative election will  take place in September 2021. The GSU will  follow class rep elections with NStEP training in  October 2021 and top-up training throughout the  year.  </span></p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;"> I CARE about social and environmental  sustainability. Innovation is not simply about technology or business, It is about<span id="dots7">...</span><span id="more7"> doing  things differently and better. As GSU President  I will push the College to develop a culture of  innovation which responds to challenges with  imagination, collaboration and ambition and  contributes to progress on climate targets and  the UN SDGs. I will continue to support the  Trinity Swift project to encourage the birds to  nest on the north face of the Museum Building  to nest in 2021/2022. In April 2020 and April  2021 I activated the swift bird callers in the  Museum Building to facilitate the project for  PhD Jamie Rohu and swift Conservation Ireland.  I believe that wildlife belongs to no one and the  wilding of Trinity as a hub for wild species and  birds is something that the Union will continue  to support in 2022.</span></p>

This framework has helped us to introduce  the Living Wage onto campus, to add a third  Sabbatical Officer for PhDs (with promised  funding) and mandated the GSU to lobby for  partial refunds on behalf of students. I will  continue to lobby College for these and foster  a postgraduate working group to review GSU  policy to encourage student engagement and  ensure that bringing motions to GSU Council is  accessible and democratic.</span></p>

Too many are suffering the <span id="dotsc3">...</span><span id="morec3">consequences of bad national policy and poor accommodation  management, with some students pushed  into homelessness and others left without  correct refunds from private landlords during  COVID-19. During my 2019/2020 GSU Vice  Presidency and 2020/2021 GSU Presidency I  actively campaigned with USI and the SU for a  national policy shift on student accommodation.  I have witnessed first-hand the exploitation of  International students which was worsened  by the pandemic. I will fight at every level for  appropriate rent controls and lobby with USI to  make it a reality across the country. In February  2021 I secured a promise of sponsorship  investment to develop the PG accommodation  Facebook page for postgraduates to become a  place of safety and sound advice.

I will be pushing for practical  implementation of the Postgraduate Spaces  Strategy which I secured as Vice President in  2019. I secured microwaves for spaces across  campus in 2019 and a commitment from  Disability for a development of the 1937 Reading  Room with a million Euro budget attached in  2020, and extra funding from the new Provost  in 2021. I have lobbied for extra PhD desk  space and have secured it both in the 1937  Reading Room with a plan in motion to deliver  safe, clean study space like the hub both on  and off campus. Many students are particularly  concerned about the use of labs in the context of COVID-19 and I am proposing a staggered  approach to lab work which will utilise College  labs on downtime over the summer.

As President I will be  lobbying for a far greater national investment  in public research for the public good, including  frontline, basic and applied research across the  humanities and sciences. The Cassels Report  in 2011 called for a new national research and  development strategy, Innovation 2020, which  expires last year without reaching its potential.  The development of its replacement, the  National Research Strategy has been slowed  because of COVDI-19 and as GSU President I  intend to seize this opportunity to make sure  postgraduate researchers are heard in the  design of that strategy in 2021/22.

Currently  PhD Stipends are not calculated<span id="dotsr2">...</span><span id="morer2"> on the living  wage in the city where the researcher is based  and a budget for personal equipment such as  laptops, books, printing, conference attendance  etc. is not included in all state scholarships.  As research can take many years, it is also  essential that postgraduate students and  researchers have access to secure, year-round,  long-term tenancies. I increased beds for  postgraduates on campus in 2019/20 and will  lobby again in 2021 for lease agreements and  to have the rent reviewed as it is currently very  high. As president 2021/22, I will continue to  press for progress on both these issues as part of a more integrated approach to PhD supports.

Research  students deserve certainty of hours in teaching  and tutorial work and set hourly rate of pay for  all hours worked – including preparatory and  correction work. In February 2021 I lobbied  at Finance Committee to instruct The Human  Resources Committee at Trinity College Dublin  to create an Occasional Staff and Casual Pay  Policy. I’ve consulted with the chair of IFUT and  as Unions we have met to offer further input  to HR.

PhDs work many hours<span id="dotsr5">...</span><span id="morer5">  across Trinity College as part of the current structure in place. The  current structure has caused me to question at  every level how College would function without  PhDs. PhDs demonstrate, give tutorials, grade  papers, are in charge of lab maintenance. Plus,  PhDs do also work on an informal basis, such  as assisting in supervision of undergraduate  research projects, for which they receive no  recognition – this needs to change. Many  PhD students this year are struggling and are  utterly devoted to a subject out of vocation  and a love of research but cannot attain  financial stability. Currently there are no formal  contracts specifying working hours, any rights  or obligations issued by Schools even though  other national institutions do indeed give  contracts to their part-time workers. I believe all  PhDs need to be given clear and fair contracts  for the essential work they provide to Schools,  covering research activities as well as teaching,  without which these Schools would be unable  to function normally. Ultimately, this must lead  to PhDs eventually obtaining employee status  and the protections it entails and I have lobbied  since 2019 for this for PhDs and pushed for a  firm commitment on this from the Provost Elect  in GSU focus groups held in March 2021 and at  the Provost Hustings in March/April 2021.</span></p>

The time period between finishing  a PhD and finding a post-doc role should be  streamlined to allow doctoral students who  have completed all of their requirements but  not formally graduated to apply for funding  and jobs. In November 2021 I investigated  the various post-docs pathways, in Chemistry doctoral students apply for post-docs before  graduation but in professionally accredited jobs  like psychology postgraduate researchers may  face delays in securing an academic position  and I intend to develop active partnerships to  identity opportunities that might open up new  horizons and alternative career paths for these  postgraduates. I will, for example, engage with  the College to look at extension, improvement  and diversification of placement strategy.

It was outlined  at Graduate Studies Committee in 2019/2020  that many students in FAHSS are unfunded, and  I am further concerned that those students that  are funded, receive stipends that are well below  the living wage. I have also become acutely  aware that poor funding reduces diversity of  the student body, as many people simply can’t  afford to do a PhD, particularly International  students who received little to no funding or  indeed people from an Irish socio-economically  challenged background. I have also become  acutely aware that poor funding reduces  diversity of the student body, as many people  simply can’t afford to do a PhD, particularly  International students who received little to  no funding or indeed people from a socio economically challenged background . I have  also noted that students who get accepted to  pursue research face such financial pressures, it  plays on the mental health of our postgraduates  and invariably can impoverish the quality of the  work that is being done. As rents continue to  increase in Ireland, it is my real concern that  this position is simply unsustainable. Current  Government policy – both in terms of the core  grant system dolled out to the universities and  funding directed to external bodies like IRC  and SFI – is such that institutions and funding  bodies are co-dependent. We must then as  a Union stand up for Irish research and hope  that government hears the message that a  restructure of funding and a re-think of the  system is long overdue for 2021.

The total value of an  award increased from €24,000 pa to €27,500.  In addition funding research consumables  went from €2,250 to €3,250. As President I will  further address this as this increase does not  fully cover fees and all research consumables  and is also far below the living wage in Ireland.  I will lobby College to increase the threshold  point at which supplemental income impacts  grant awardee status. It’s a further freedom  to T.A.s and demonstrators and anyone doing  corrections and will also offer more freedom to  postgraduates who work as supervisors. These  students are usually funded by bodies (such as  the IRC, SFI, or the Schools themselves) that  provide a stipend below the minimum wage (and  far below the living wage) in Ireland.
