                        <h2>Digital Passport Queries</h2>
                        <p>
                            This evening ten countries have started to roll out digital passports and many of you
                            have asked about travel and obtaining a digital passport here.
                            <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">
                            I have asked about this for you and it will be six weeks from July 1st before the system
                            will be in place to issue e-certificates which includes a vaccination history and
                            whether or not you had COVID-19 and when you’ve had it etc... Currently no GP system
                            in the country is linked up to do that. Most people have had their test from their
                            local GP surgery. Most tests last month were all referrals from GPs so that’s where
                            the results are, as well as in the National reference lab so there isn’t any template
                            at the moment for this to appear. The HSE has been at the forefront of the digital
                            framework for this but as of yet, no GP in the country has been asked how these results
                            might be accessed. So July 1st for digital passports is, I’m told unfortunately very
                            optimistic.

                        <p>
                            I have partnered with the President of the University of Limerick to write to Minister Simon Harris on behalf of International (Non-EU) PhD students
                            <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">
                            concerning visa permissions for spouses and partners of international students which is currently unclear.  Similarly, the 7- year visa limit on student visas for international students is ambiguous and unfair: it precludes an international student from availing of the Third Level Graduate Programme where studying undergraduate level 8 and then progressing to level 10, a student will have reached the 7-year limit. The 7-year visa limit is cumbersome and bureaucratic for those of you progressing to level 10. These decisions are impacting the mental health and wellbeing of International PhD students and I am lobbying to have this addressed immediately by the Minister and the Department of Justice.

Members of this group will have space to process concerns and stressors through a strengths-based, non-pathologizing format. All Trinity students who identify as members of the broader LGBTQ+ community are welcome and welcome and encouraged to join.

                            India is going through a heartbreaking second wave of COVID-19 infections at this time with numbers reaching above 380,000 cases reported with
                            <span id="dots10">...</span><span id="more10">
                            3600 deaths per day, and this is expected to be surpassed in the coming months. India is losing 243 lives per minute. As bad as the numbers seem, some conservative estimates suggest the actual numbers are at least twice that, as images of a sea of makeshift cremation pyres and burial grounds inundate the social and news media every day.
                            <p>Currently oxygen, oxygen cylinders, ventilators and ICU beds are in short supply in the worst hit cities. People are waiting for days outside hospitals and family members are scramming to procure oxygen while critical patients wait and die. More recently, vaccines, COVID-19 testing kits and PPE equipment shortages have started to occur due to the sheer load of cases in certain areas.
                            </p>
                            <p>Deeply concerned by the impact that COVID-19 is having on lives and livelihoods of our Indian community both here in Ireland and abroad, we, the President Gisèle Scanlon, Vice-President Abhisweta Bhattacharjee and the Indian student community of Trinity College Dublin Graduate Students’ Union, would like to seek your support in collecting relief funds. The funds collected will be distributed and sent to organizations on the ground in India, who will then use them to purchase oxygen cylinders and concentrators, ventilators, PPE kits and other necessary equipment.</p>
                            <p>The President and the Vice President have set up a special GSU team which has been working closely with people on the ground in India over the past few weeks in our best capacity. Because we now have a much deeper understanding of the challenges, and we see the urgency and the intensity of the crisis, we have decided to also raise much needed funding. Every single Euro will help bring about a positive impact in India.

                           and students with underlying conditions when I visited them for a meeting. On behalf of postgraduates whom they have vaccinated in our community we are truly thankful for their hard work and dedication. In our meeting, we discussed how vaccinations will continue to roll as all the over 70s and almost all the 60s are vaccinated, many of the cohort 4s (the 18 to 59 year old age group who are in the very high risk category, many of those are now vaccinated including on campus). Dr McGrath stressed that hospital admissions now for COVID-19 are generally going to be in people who are much younger (that's us) as the median age is now 25 and dropping. That’s because older people are vaccinated and younger people are more mobile and unfortunately, it’s something we still need to be aware of when socialising. Dr. McGrath asked me to please remind everyone to keep the masks on, to socially distance and to keep the hand washing vigilant as this will keep everyone on campus safe and well. Dr. McGrath and his team are trying to vaccinate as many people as quickly as they can and we look forward to a day when all students are vaccinated soon.

Although the Library has may books and Journals and databases free to access online during the coronavirus outbreak, they may not have what you need.

Staying in touch with other researchers is a great way to help address isolation and in discussion with many of you we understand that you would like a new space where the community can offer you motivation and help tackle the crippling effects of lack of feedback and anxiety.Our Faculty Officers and GSU Executive have been hosting coffee mornings which have become very popular among researchers and we’re ready to develop these onto the next step. We are seeking to set up pockets of support (numerous groups of students per school) across the PGR Community and we will work with you to bring researchers at similar stages together to provide support over the coming weeks.

We’ve updated the website last month to incorporate the ten schools currently operating Trini-Screen and I’m working with College to extend testing to The Long Room Hub this week and across the entire PG Community for the summer months to offer you all better protection on top of your vaccination.

I had the Lavazza machine in the 1937 Reading Room calibrated to dispense FREE hot water for the postgraduate population and College Catering has re-granted my FREE hot water request and has made it available across the outlets which are currently open in Trinity College Dublin for ALL students. Here's how it works: Bring YOUR OWN  “keep cup” cup, flask or bowl and hot water is FREE to request! I am extremely grateful to Catering and will continue to press for fixes to your problems, so do please let me know if you need anything. Here are the current venues with six more to open when campus reopens: The Buttery, (Front Square) - there are boilers there. Ask for it.

                            store for a chance to win the €250 prize. Thank You to everyone who entered, we had a huge response. The winner was David Kelly and here is his winning entry… “This is a bit of a long shot but I said sure I'd give it a go! The Mother is fond of the odd bottle of wine but she is more fond of the tree's in Trinity and has always loved coming up and admiring them, especially when we would go to the Christmas carol concert. I saw that the gift shop sells a wine bottle holder that is made from trees felled actually on campus. Mam was honestly so sad when the huge one came crashing down 2 years ago so it would be amazing to say that she now (maybe) has some of that tree in her very own kitchen! Anyway thanks for reading and I wish you a lovely Christmas.” Congratulations David, we hope that you enjoy your prize.

                            use if you were already on campus and needed to attend an online class shortly before or after in a safe, warm and managed environment. Very many of you who were already reading/studying in the 1937 Reading Room asked about having safe space like this to take an online class on campus so this morning we have extended the online class spaces to include new spaces across campus for you namely: the Exam Hall, Front Square, the Botany Bay Marquee and The Bank in the Hamilton Building on East campus. These spaces are open from 9:00am – 6:00pm, Monday to Friday and you can book a desk for one or two hours or individual rooms in The Bank. Please remember to book to get access to this service and each ticket is for 1 hour. If your class if longer, please book two slots if your class is 2 hours. Power sockets are limited so charge your computer fully before you arrive and headsets must be worn. If you decide that you don’t need the booking, please cancel your ticket through Eventbrite, so others can get access. We have a sign-in system using the QR code at the front door, and sign-out using the QR code on your desk.

We have worked hard with the Trinity College Library staff to facilitate this opening and we would ask please that when entering the building that face coverings be worn and kept in place for the duration of your stay in the 1937 Reading Room. Postgraduate stewards will be on site from opening until closing to ensure your safety. For efficiency and fairness and to ensure that we adhere to government guidelines in level 3, there are 50 tickets and you can book a seat/desk for a two or three hour reading slot per day. This GSU booking system in the 1937 Reading Room will run from September 28th to October 4th until the library implements its new booking system for the 1937.

                            many of you will be worried as to what this means for you moving forward with your research, teaching and demonstrating work in labs. The key pillars to staying safe on campus involves personal responsibility for behaviours such as social distancing, regular and effective hand washing and appropriate cough and sneeze etiquette. The government has issued the 4 W’s for the Dublin area on Level 3 and we at the GSU have configured these guidelines in a sharable infographic for you above. In College, teaching spaces have been configured in line with the directive issued by the HEA to ensure distancing between students, with a 1m distance between student workstations and 2m distance between teaching staff and students. The wearing of face coverings will be mandatory for all teaching and learning events for all students and staff, in all the Libraries and in internal public spaces on campus. It is imperative to wear and keep a face covering in place when occupying all internal spaces in College including library spaces. I helped make a video to outline the importance of this.
